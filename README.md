# Switch-N-Sense
High-side NMOS power switch and current sense resistor for battery applications

This device will be the power part of the next generation Libre Solar 24V-48V BMS, but can also be used for lead-acid battery protection switches.

## Design considerations

The MOSFETs and the sense resistors are mounted at the back side of the PCB and should be attached to a large heat sink via thermal interface materials (e.g. thermal pad).

[WÃ¼rth Power Elements WP-BUCF (order code 7461059)](https://powerelement.we-online.de/p/s/1406/93172-PowerOne-Bush-vertical-through-hole.html) are used for wire to board connection.

## Current target

Current rating can be adjusted depending on chosen MOSFETs and sense resistors.

- Maximum number of MOSFETs: 2
- Maximum number of sense resitors (2512): 4

Targets for fully populated PCB (total heat dissipation approx. 20 W in MOSFETs, connectors and sense resistor at full current):

| MOSFET (2x) | Voltage | Maximum Current | Remark            |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| FDMT80080DC | 48V     | 80 A            |                   |
| FDMT80060DC | 12V/24V | 100 A           |                   |
| CSD18540Q5B | 12V/24V | 60 A            | cheap alternative |
